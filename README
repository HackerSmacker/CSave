specified in the LICENSE file. Failure to comply with the terms
and conditions may result in an arrangement of issues. As such,

Compiling on Unix:
1. Install libprotobuf-c. Follow the applicable installation
instructions. If you are installing it in /usr/local and 
/usr/local/lib is not in your library path, please execute
"export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib:/lib" before
continuing.
2. Compile CSave. This is as easy as installing GNU Make (which
is probably already on your machine) and typing "make". Do a
parallel make, "make -j12", if you want. 
3. Read the documentation. Open and read the file named HELP.

Compiling on Windows (Cygwin):
1. Install libprotobuf-c the same way you would do on Unix.
