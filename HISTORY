Completely Useless History (i.e. Questions you didn't ask and answers) Document on CSave

1. When did I start this?
9/12/2020. Originally it was just a novel idea of "what kinda stuff can I do with
protobuf-c" but it evolved into a save editor.

2. What's with that dumb CSAV001xxx message prefixes? 
Well, if you've used MVS, VM/CMS, or VSE, it will look familiar. I've been using
this scheme for a while now, mainly such that I can grep away for some particular
output. Does it add to the verbosity of the already verbose output? Yes. Does it
overload your 9600 baud VT100? You bet. Do you have to pay for the paper running
off of your Teletype/3215? I sure hope not!

3. So, does it run on VMS or not?
(9/2/22) Yes.

4. Does it compile on VM/CMS?
Nope. (update 5/4/21: kinda, but the endianess is completely off and it's basically
useless)

5. What's with the bad code style?
This was written in a few very short and very fast coding runs, and this was never
meant to be production-grade software.
