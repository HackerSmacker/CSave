Completely Useless History (i.e. Questions you didn't ask and answers) Document on CSave

1. When did I start this?
9/12/2020. Originally it was just a novel idea of "what kinda stuff can I do with
protobuf-c" but it evolved into a save editor.

2. Where was this originally stored?
hpux11_dev.hsnet.local (HP-UX B.11.11 development machine, mainly for testing out
non-GNU C compilers. It's an HP-9000 712, it's slow as Christmas.)

3. Does this run on MVS?
Well, not yet. I doubt that JCC can compile this, mainly because I've gotta first
get libprotobuf-c (it should be noted that this project did originate on MVS, but
was promptly moved off of MVS because of this C compilation issue)

4. What's with that dumb CSAV001xxx message prefixes? 
Well, if you've used MVS, VM/CMS, or VSE, it will look familiar. I've been using
this scheme for a while now, mainly such that I can grep away for some particular
output. Does it add to the verbosity of the already verbose output? Yes. Does it
overload your 9600 baud VT100? You bet. Do you have to pay for the paper running
off of your Teletype/3215? I sure hope not!

5. So, does it run on VMS or not?
Well, kinda. You have to cross compile this bad boy from some other system that
has GCC. Copy over the EXEs and have at it.

6. Does it compile on VM/CMS?
Nope. (update 5/4/21: kinda, but the endianess is completely off and it's basically
useless)
